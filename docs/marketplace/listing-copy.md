Feature-Reacher is a documentation analysis tool that identifies potential feature adoption risks in your product. Simply paste your release notes, help center articles, or FAQs, and Feature-Reacher will surface features that may be underutilized—backed by cited evidence, not guesswork.

**Key Benefits:**

• **No Analytics Required** — Don't have usage data? No problem. Feature-Reacher works with what you already have: product documentation.

• **Evidence-Backed Insights** — Every diagnosis includes cited evidence from your documents. Trace any finding back to its source. No AI hallucinations or black boxes.

• **Repeatable Audits** — Save artifact collections and compare audits over time. Track improvement with trend visualizations.

• **Stakeholder-Ready Reports** — Export professional executive summaries for leadership and partners. Template-driven output, consistent format.

**How It Works:**

1. Upload your documentation (release notes, help articles, FAQs)
2. Run the Adoption Risk Audit
3. Review ranked features with evidence and recommendations
4. Export reports for stakeholders

**Privacy-First Design:**

All data is stored locally in your browser. No cloud sync, no external servers, no account required. You control your data completely.

**Perfect For:**

• Product Managers seeking to improve feature discovery
• Documentation Teams optimizing help content
• Technical Writers identifying documentation gaps
• Customer Success Teams understanding adoption patterns
