# Feature-Reacher

## What This Does (Prototype)

⚠️ **Prototype Status** — Semantic feature mining and anchor generation.

Analyzes product documentation and code to extract key features,
then generates encoder-optimized visual anchors for design/marketing applications.

## Architecture

- Feature extraction from product text
- Semantic analysis and ranking
- Metaphor and anchor generation
- Token-aware prompt compilation
- Integration with diffusion models

## Use Cases

- Logo design prompt generation
- Visual anchor identification
- Design brief automation
- Feature-to-visual mapping

## Key Notes

- Early-stage prototype
- Token optimization is critical
- Works with CLIP/T5 tokenizers
- Designed to feed diffusion pipelines
